How to get it
-------------

USB RetroPad Adapter is Opensource / Open hardware, so you can construct your
PCB, compile the source code, burn the firmware in the micro-controller and
start using it. 

However, there are people who are not familiar with PCB manufacturing process
nor have the skills, or even time, to construct his/her own adapter. For those
people, you are invited to contact me at bootsector@ig.com.br so I can sell
you a ready-to-use adapter! :)
