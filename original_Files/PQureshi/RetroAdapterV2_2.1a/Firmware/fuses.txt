NOTE: If you are just updating the firmware, you don't need to worry about any of this.

Fuse settings for the ATmega168
===============================

low:		0xef
high:		0xdf
extended:	0xf8


To program with avrdude use the following command line:

> avrdude -c <your programmer> -p atmega168 -U lfuse:w:0xef:m -U hfuse:w:0xdf:m -U efuse:w:0xf8:m

Ignore warnings about the efuse not being set properly, it is a limitation of avrdude.
